# These are projects I've done so far with Python and R. 
# For Python project, I mainly focused on the process of building a linear regression model. I also tested the efficiency of the model by applying test set data(which is not included in the dataset and the code). 
#For the R project, I mainly focused on data visualization and basic data analysis for both numeric data and catagorical data.
